
Summary statistics

We provide column summary statistics for RDD[Vector] through the function colStats available in Statistics.


colStats() returns an instance of MultivariateStatisticalSummary, which contains the column-wise max, min, mean, variance, and number of nonzeros, as well as the total count.

from pyspark.mllib.stat import Statistics

sc = ... # SparkContext

mat = ... # an RDD of Vectors

# Compute column summary statistics.
summary = Statistics.colStats(mat)
print(summary.mean())
print(summary.variance())
print(summary.numNonzeros())
